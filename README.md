# TivaLP_Cover
OpenSCAD cover for the Tiva EK-TM4C123GXL LaunchPad

This is a 3-part enclosure for a TivaLP mated with a custom carrier board (AKA, shield board).  The two main parts are the Bottom and the Lid.  A third part is a clear or semi-clear light-pipe printed into the Lid.  This requires a printer with a multi-filament head in order to print as one piece.  Printing the light-pipe separately is an option, but would require a degree of manual finishing to the light-pipe and the receptor hole in the Lid.

Comments inside the OpenSCAD file describe how to create the three plots and also how to manipulate the file to produce fit-check "plots" where the pieces are all arranged in an "as assembled" fashion.

The carrier board is custom.  Details on this board will be added later.
